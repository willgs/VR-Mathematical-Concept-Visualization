Progress: Research on what platform to base main product
The blocking part of this project is the decision whether we use and create most of the functionality as
a matlab add-on, or to construct our own application (through Java). Through research, we have decided
that a matlab add-on would be the best because it is more likely that we can keep the conversion algorithm
which is open source. Implementing this algorithm in java will likely prove to be unnecessarily difficult.

Items for C/Stephenson: None
