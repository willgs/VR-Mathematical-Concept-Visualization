Week Of: 11 Feb
Team Members: Murdock, Ranalli

Progress: GUI now works with central bus by outputting object file to a selected file location. The layout and design of the app
still need to be tampered with, but the functionality is there.

Slight edits were made to lines 41 and 42 of convert.m to work with GUI - reuploaded as GUI-convert.

All central bus files are packaged together when app is installed with WeekFeb11.mlappinstall


Items for team or C/Stephenson: None
