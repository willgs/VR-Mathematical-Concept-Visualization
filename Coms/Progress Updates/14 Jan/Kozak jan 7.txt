 Progress Updates
Week Of: January 7th
Team Members: Kozak

Progress: Reestablished contact with Pitt News
We are currently on the Pitt News schedule. Their expectation is to send out the article (putting us around January 24th/25th).
One of the editors said that they will be in contact with me shortly to set up a meeting (expecting a few days). My intention is to have all the members of the Pitt Cyber team
be present for the interview. Each AS400 can discuss a little bit of their part in the project.



Items for team or C/Stephenson: Find a good meeting time for all of us to hold the interview day/time for.
