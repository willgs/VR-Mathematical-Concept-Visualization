Last week: A lot of stalling because of the locks and the language discussion.

McWherter/Guinter
    Forward the invoice to me and keep the log updated on the tax refund.  PC and Vive set up next week.

Kozak
    Who is your contact at the Pitt News?  Who is Griffin and who is Joanna Li?

Murdock/Ranalli
    Create hello world gui and driver.    

Liszka/Oswald 
    Implement Central bus - see architecture screenshot.  This will be the main script run by the App
    
Next Week: No meeting, I'll be checking in via groupme to see where everyone is at and updating from there.  One last note, need a 
volunteer for inventory either tommorow or late Wednesday or Thursday.
