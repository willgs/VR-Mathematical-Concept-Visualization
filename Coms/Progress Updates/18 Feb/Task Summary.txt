Last week: None

McWherter/Guinter/Oswald

Murdock/Ranalli
    Cosmetic changes to the GUI: Move the convert button to the bottom right, move everything else down enough to put an image and a title
    centered at the top.  use the image in this folder.  Have a title under the image, the title should be the name of this 
    repo (without dashes).  The title and image should be centered, make the title font bigger than the other fonts.
    Have the GUI close after the user presses convert.

Liszka/Oswald 
    Work on debugging file conversion and finding good example cases
    
Next week: Hoping to demo for Col Bishop next week
