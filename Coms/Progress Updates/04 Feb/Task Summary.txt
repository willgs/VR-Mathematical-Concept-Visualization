Last week: None

McWherter/Guinter
    Finish PC setup and Vive this week.  I'll reach out to Mr Lange and see if he is interested in seeing our set up.

Kozak
    Work on follow up article, what time frame was he interested in?  Have you been taking pictures with C/McWherter?

Murdock/Ranalli
    Change GUi to be able to accept file paths as strings and pass them through a function.  Make sure the file paths all end in .fig
    Create a function to read the raw data at the end of the paths.  We are reading figure files, the file paths should all end in .fig 

Liszka/Oswald 
    Work on file conversion, focus on reading isosurfaces from figure files.
    
Next Week: Please submit progress updates and code!
